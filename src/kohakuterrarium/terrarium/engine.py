"""Terrarium runtime engine.

The engine hosts every running creature in the process and owns the
graph-level state (which creatures share a session, which channels
exist, who listens / sends).  A standalone ``kt run creature.yaml``
becomes a 1-creature graph; a multi-agent recipe becomes one or more
larger graphs.  Topology can change at runtime — channels can be
added or rewired between any pair of creatures, and the engine fans
the change out to live agents (channel-trigger injection, environment
union on graph merge, session-store copy on graph split).

        ``config`` may be a path (or ``@pkg/...`` reference),
        ``AgentConfig``, ``CreatureConfig``, or a pre-built ``Creature``
        (tests / advanced callers).  With ``graph=None`` a fresh
        singleton graph is minted.  ``start`` toggles auto-start of the
        underlying agent.

        ``llm`` binds the creature's LLM — a provider instance, a
        selector string, an ``LLMProfile``, or None (resolve from the
        config).

        ``io`` selects how much of the config's I/O boots:
        ``"config"`` (as declared), ``"none"`` (input suppressed —
        Studio / Lab managed spawns driven via the attach WebSocket),
        or ``"headless"`` (input suppressed AND default output
        silenced — batch / programmatic runs).

        ``session`` controls persistence without requiring callers to manually
        create a ``SessionStore``, initialize metadata, and attach it:
        a path mints the store at exactly that file; ``True`` mints in
        the default session dir; ``False`` disables persistence even
        under autosession; a ``SessionStore`` attaches as-is; ``None``
        (default) follows the engine — autosession when
        ``Terrarium(session_dir=...)`` was set, joins the graph's
        existing store otherwise, else no persistence.

        ``name`` is a spawn-time display-name override (the name the
        user typed in the Studio "new creature" form).  When set it is
        applied across the creature + its nested objects, so a creature
        spawned on a worker carries the user's chosen name — not the
        config file's own ``name``.

        ``tools`` / ``plugins`` are INSTANCES (e.g. ``kt.tool``
        adapters, ``BasePlugin`` subclass objects) injected into the
        underlying agent at build time — same contract as
        ``Agent.build(tools=, plugins=)``.  Not applicable to a
        pre-built ``Creature`` (raises like the other build kwargs).

        ``is_privileged`` marks the creature as having access to the
        group_* tool surface — set by direct user actions (solo
        ``kt run``, Studio "new creature") and by recipe-root assignment
        (via :meth:`assign_root`). False for tool-spawned workers.
        **Elevate-only**: passing ``False`` here on a pre-built
        :class:`Creature` whose ``is_privileged`` is already ``True``
        (tests, advanced callers) does not demote it. Callers cannot
        downgrade privilege through this method.

        ``parent_creature_id`` is also additive: it overwrites only when
        non-None. None means "leave whatever the pre-built creature
        already has."

        Example: ``alice = await t.add_creature("alice.yaml")``.
